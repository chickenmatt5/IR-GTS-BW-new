{"name":"IR-GTS-BW-new","tagline":"Fake GTS for gen 5 Pokemon games","body":"IR-GTS-BW-new\r\n=============\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nIR-GTS-BW-new is a script that creates a fake GTS server on your computer so you can connect your Pokemon games to it and send & receive Pokemon on your computer. Pokemon are stored in files with the extension (end part) \".pkm\". IR-GTS-BW-new can also do basic hack-checking and stat reading of Pokemon in .pkm files. Pokemon can be backed up and saved on a computer in a .pkm file, and any Pokemon in .pkm file format can be sent to a game.\r\n\r\n(Pokecheck.org features coming soon!)\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis project has been tested extensively on Windows, thoroughly on Linux (wheezy and iOS), and not at all on all other platforms. You have been warned.\r\n\r\nAnd in case this needs to be stated, **IR-GTS-BW-new (this project) only supports generation 5 Pokemon games: Black, White, Black 2, and White 2.**\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n## Download and Install Python\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to download Python. And not any old Python, Python 2.7. [Here's the download page](http://www.python.org/download/), and remember to download Python 2.7, not Python 3!\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in using IR-GTS-BW-new on an iOS device, you can download and install Python 2.7 from this repo: http://yangapp.googlecode.com/svn/ or [use this .deb](http://yangapp.googlecode.com/svn/debs/python_2.7.6-3_iphoneos-arm.deb).\r\n\r\n## Download IR-GTS-BW-new\r\n\r\nYou should see a \"Download .zip\" button at the top of this page. Press it, and unzip the downloaded file's contents somewhere on your computer.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nCheck the next section down if you need any extra help with setup. \r\n\r\n## Run IR-GTS-BW-new\r\n\r\nInside all the unzipped stuff, you should find \"ir-gts-bw-new.py.\" Double-click it and follow the potentially easy menus and instructions!\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\n## Wireless Network\r\n\r\nThe computer that you'll be running IR-GTS-BW-new on and the DS you'll have your Pokemon game in need to be on the same wireless network, or wifi.\r\n\r\n## DNS Settings\r\n\r\nYou will need to change the DNS settings on your DS, so be familiar with how to. [Here's a pretty good guide](https://www.pokedit.com/support/gts-how-to-send-pokemon-to-your-game.php) that covers just about everything. Just make sure to not use the DNS address that's included in the guide, and instead use the one that IR-GTS-BW-new tells you to.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nIR-GTS-BW-new is a resurrection/modification/continuation of the [Infinite Recursion GTS project](https://code.google.com/p/ir-gts/) distributed under the GNU GPL v3, and by the express permission of the original creators, infinitely.recursive and LordLandon.","google":"UA-48102124-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
