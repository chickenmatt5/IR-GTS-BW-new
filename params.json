You have been warned.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n## Download and Install Python\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to download Python. And not any old Python, Python 2.7. [Here's the download page](http://www.python.org/download/), and remember to download Python 2.7, not Python 3!\r\n\r\n## Download IR-GTS-BW-new\r\n\r\nYou should see a \"Download .zip\" button at the top of this page. Press it, and unzip the downloaded file's contents somewhere on your computer.\r\n\r\n## Run IR-GTS-BW-new\r\n\r\nInside all the unzipped stuff, you should find \"ir-gts-bw-new.py.\" Double-click it and follow the potentially easy menus and instructions!","google":"UA-48102124-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
